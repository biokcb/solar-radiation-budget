# Solar Radiation Budget Project

This project was a part of an HPC Scientific Visualization course offered through CU Boulder. We utilized Python, VisIt, and Jupyter notebooks throughout the course to analyze and visualize many different types of datasets. This project creates visualizations describing the Earth's Solar Radiation Budget and takes a look at the recent changes in different climate variables. 

We created several static images and animated movies on Janus using real data. The final presentation was a full, edited movie with background information (custom animations created in Python), exploring the data with visuals and narration, you can view it by clicking the image below:
