# Solar Radiation Budget Project

This project was a part of an HPC Scientific Visualization course offered through CU Boulder. We utilized Python, VisIt, and Jupyter notebooks throughout the course to analyze and visualize many different types of datasets. This project creates visualizations describing the Earth's Solar Radiation Budget and takes a look at the recent changes in different climate variables.
